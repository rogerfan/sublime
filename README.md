sublime
=======

Settings used for Sublime Text.

To use, cd into `Packages/Users/` and run

```
git clone https://github.com/rogerfan/sublime.git ./
```

Package Control must be installed manually ([instructions](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)).

Note: Boxy is no longer supported. A copy of the needed files is contained in `Boxy.zip`. Decompress it, put the folders in `Packages/`, and put `Boxy Theme.sublime-package` in `Installed Packages/`.
